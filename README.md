### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, it was somewhat helpful. Alot of topics were found throughout other students. I felt unprepared about searching the movie, resetting and loading more. Also for the project it felt ruhed. We only had one day in class to fully complete and I spend alot of time away from work to complete the project.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would've got my load more to work and be displayed at the end of the screen. Since it not fully able to work you're only now allowed to see 30 movies.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What went well in my project is being able to display my now playing screen and also being able to effectively use my search button as well. I think this made a major difference in my project because it took me a long time to implement both but as soon as I got my now playing screen to work it made the search easier. Something I noticed that my parents did is also to be able to hold her over the movie to display the description and if I had more time I would've effectively coded the movie description.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
Christian! Moe also to being able to help me with my project and communicating on the weekends outside of work!
